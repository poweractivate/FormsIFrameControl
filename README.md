This uses Power Apps Component Framework (PCF).
This is a custom Code Component which requires enabling a specific feature in your environment and performing some steps (see discussion for moe detail) 
before it can be added to your Canvas App.

Be sure to observe all warnings about running untrusted code and use caution.

Highly recommend backing up your app a few times first before using this Componebt, and also highly recommend using a separate Power Apps environment to test your app with this Component thoroughly first before deploying it to your real production environment.

You assume all risk using any code in this repo in your production environment, or any environment.
